## Project Description

This project is a web application designed for managing various aspects of a product catalog, including categories, subcategories, and products. It provides functionalities for authentication, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on categories, subcategories, and products. The application has both frontend and backend components, each fulfilling specific roles in the overall system.

## Frontend

The frontend of the application is built using React and provides a user-friendly interface for managing categories, subcategories, and products. The key features and functionalities include:

- **Login & Authentication**: Users can log in, sign up, and reset their passwords.
- **Dashboard**: A central area for navigating through the application.
- **Category Management**: Users can view, add, edit, and manage categories.
- **Subcategory Management**: Users can view, add, edit, and manage subcategories, with each subcategory associated with a category.
- **Product Management**: Users can view, add, edit, and manage products, with each product associated with a category and subcategory.
- **Image Upload**: Allows uploading and previewing images for categories and products.
- **Private Routes**: Certain routes are protected and accessible only to authenticated users.

## Backend

The backend is built using Node.js with Express.js and provides RESTful APIs for the frontend to interact with. The key features and functionalities include:

- **Authentication**: Handles user registration, login, and password management.
- **Category API**: Endpoints for CRUD operations on categories.
- **Subcategory API**: Endpoints for CRUD operations on subcategories.
- **Product API**: Endpoints for CRUD operations on products.
